# --- What this is -------------------------------------------------------
# Opt-in Midstate miner launcher: mines on THIS machine, to YOUR own
# payout address, only while you choose to run it. Not silent or hidden,
# and does not install or run itself on anyone else's computer. Standard
# pool miner for the public Midstate proof-of-work chain. See README.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ============================================================
#  Self-updating launcher. Leave this running.
#   * Runs the miner to your address. Midstate's PoW is a
#     SEQUENTIAL BLAKE3 chain (GPU-resistant), so a good CPU is
#     only a few× behind a GPU — both builds are worth running.
#     The nvidia build also spawns one process per GPU device.
#   * Checks GitHub for the latest release every CHECK_MIN
#     minutes. A new version is gated through THREE checks before
#     it ever runs (brick-safe hardening):
#       1. semver compare (the miner's own `check-update`, so
#          0.1.10 is correctly newer than 0.1.9 — a string "!="
#          got this wrong),
#       2. download to a TEMP path (never onto the live binary),
#       3. SHA-256 verify against the release SHA256SUMS (the
#          miner's own `verify-file`) BEFORE the atomic swap.
#     A failed verify discards the temp and keeps the running
#     binary; the rig never executes an unverified download.
#   * Liveness is checked on a SHORT cadence (LIVE_SEC), decoupled
#     from the slow update poll, with ESCALATING BACKOFF so a
#     crash-looping rig doesn't hammer (5s,15s,60s capped). After
#     MAX_RESTARTS rapid restarts it backs off and (optionally)
#     runs your MIDSTATE_ON_CRASH hook.
#  Build (default cpu; nvidia for an NVIDIA GPU):
#     ./mine-auto.sh nvidia
#  Stop everything: Ctrl+C (this also stops the miners).
#
#  Env knobs (all optional):
#     CHECK_MIN     update-poll period in minutes        (default 15)
#     LIVE_SEC      liveness-check period in seconds      (default 30)
#     MAX_RESTARTS  rapid restarts before backing off     (default 5)
#     MIDSTATE_GPU_IDS  comma list of GPU ids to mine, e.g.
#                   "0,2" to skip card 1 (default: all cards,
#                   nvidia build only)
#     MIDSTATE_ON_CRASH  path to a script run once when the
#                   restart cap is hit (driver reset, etc.)

# WHY: download_verify_swap above swaps only the miner BINARY ($BIN); a fix to
# THIS script would otherwise never reach a rig that only ever runs the old
# on-disk launcher. So after a verified binary swap we also refresh the launcher —
# but with the SAME three-gate discipline and two extra hard safety rules, because
# a bad launcher is a brick, not just a stale miner:
#
#   SAFETY (a) FAIL-CLOSED: a download failure, a missing/!listed SHA256SUMS
#     entry for "$SELF_NAME", a SHA mismatch, or no trusted verifier ALL discard
#     the temp and leave the on-disk launcher byte-for-byte untouched. The rig
#     keeps running the known-good launcher. We never write an unverified script
#     over ourselves.
#   SAFETY (b) NO-BRICK / NO RE-EXEC: we DO NOT exec the new launcher mid-run.
#     A re-exec of a subtly-broken new script could crash-loop the rig with no
#     human present (no clawback). Instead we replace the file ATOMICALLY on disk
#     (write temp → mv) and let it take effect on the NEXT operator start/restart
#     of mine-auto.sh. The currently-running process keeps using the already-
#     loaded (old) script text, so this launch can never be bricked by the swap.
#     We also keep "$SELF_PATH.bak" (the prior launcher) as a manual fallback.
#
# Verifier trust: we verify with the just-swapped, already-SHA-verified $BIN
# ("$BIN verify-file") or the OS sha256sum — NEVER by letting the downloaded
# script check itself. Returns non-zero on any skip/failure; the caller treats
# this as purely best-effort and ignores the result (a launcher-update failure
