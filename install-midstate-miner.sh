#  Midstate Pool Miner - all-in-one installer for Ubuntu / Linux.
#  Run it. It will:
#    1. Detect your GPU (NVIDIA) or fall back to CPU. Midstate's PoW
#       is a SEQUENTIAL BLAKE3 chain (GPU-resistant), so the CPU build
#       is genuinely competitive - only a few× behind a GPU.
#    2. Download the matching prebuilt miner from GitHub Releases.
#    3. Ask for your Midstate payout address once (and remember it).
#    4. Start mining to the pool.
#  Override detection:  ./install-midstate-miner.sh nvidia|cpu
#  GPU DRIVERS ARE NOT INSTALLED HERE - the nvidia build needs your
#  NVIDIA driver/runtime already present; otherwise use the cpu build.
#
#  Running via  curl ... | bash  (no terminal)? There is no TTY to
#  prompt on, so pass your address in the environment:
#     curl -fsSL <url> | MIDSTATE_ADDR=<address> bash
#  or as the second argument:  ... | bash -s -- <variant> <address>
